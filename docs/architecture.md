# Manus Twin System Architecture

## Overview
Manus Twin is designed to replicate the architecture and functionality of Manus.im while running locally on Windows and supporting multiple AI models. The system follows a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns between components.

## Core Components

### 1. Frontend Layer
- **Dashboard UI**: React-based user interface with Material UI components
- **Chat Interface**: Interactive messaging interface for communicating with AI models
- **Settings Panel**: Configuration interface for API keys and application settings
- **Model Selection**: Interface for choosing between different AI models

### 2. Backend Layer
- **Express Server**: Handles API requests and serves the frontend
- **Model Integration Interface**: Abstraction layer for interacting with different AI models
- **API Management System**: Manages API keys and provider configurations
- **Workflow Engine**: Orchestrates the execution of tasks and function calls
- **Function Calling System**: Handles tool use and function execution

### 3. Model Provider Adapters
- **Gemini Adapter**: Integration with Google's Gemini models
- **Claude Adapter**: Integration with Anthropic's Claude models
- **Custom Provider Adapter**: Support for custom model providers and endpoints

### 4. Windows Compatibility Layer
- **Electron Runtime**: Enables cross-platform desktop application capabilities
- **Local File System Access**: Manages file operations on Windows
- **System Integration**: Handles Windows-specific requirements

### 5. Data Storage
- **Settings Storage**: Persists user settings and API keys
- **Chat History Storage**: Stores conversation history
- **Function Registry**: Maintains available tools and functions

## Data Flow

1. **User Input Flow**:
   - User enters a message in the Chat Interface
   - Message is sent to the Backend Layer
   - Backend routes the message to the selected Model Provider Adapter
   - Response is returned to the Chat Interface

2. **Function Calling Flow**:
   - Model generates a function call request
   - Request is processed by the Function Calling System
   - Function is executed with provided parameters
   - Result is returned to the model for further processing
   - Final response is displayed to the user

3. **API Key Management Flow**:
   - User enters API keys in the Settings Panel
   - Keys are securely stored by the API Management System
   - Model Provider Adapters retrieve keys when making API calls

4. **Model Selection Flow**:
   - User selects a model from the Dashboard or Settings
   - Selection is stored in application settings
   - Subsequent requests are routed to the selected model

## System Interfaces

### External Interfaces
- **Model Provider APIs**: REST APIs for Gemini, Claude, and other providers
- **Local File System**: Windows file system for storing data and configurations
- **User Interface**: React-based UI for user interaction

### Internal Interfaces
- **Model Adapter Interface**: Common interface for all model providers
- **Function Registry Interface**: Interface for registering and executing functions
- **Settings Interface**: Interface for accessing and updating application settings

## Security Considerations
- API keys are stored securely using environment variables or encrypted storage
- Local data is encrypted at rest
- Network communications use HTTPS
- No sensitive data is transmitted without user consent

## Deployment Architecture
- **Electron Application**: Packaged as a Windows executable
- **Local Express Server**: Runs within the Electron process
- **Browser Window**: Renders the React frontend
- **IPC Communication**: Enables communication between frontend and backend

## Scalability Considerations
- Support for multiple concurrent conversations
- Efficient resource management for local execution
- Modular design allows for easy addition of new model providers
