- **Visual Question Answering**: Responds to questions about image content

### Usage

```typescript
// Example: Analyzing an image
const result = await axios.post('/api/multimodal/analyze', {
  imageUrl: 'https://example.com/image.jpg',
  analysisType: 'description'
});

// Example: OCR processing
const textResult = await axios.post('/api/multimodal/ocr', {
  imageUrl: 'https://example.com/document.jpg'
});
```

## Advanced Reasoning Framework

The Advanced Reasoning Framework provides sophisticated problem-solving capabilities through structured reasoning approaches.

### Features

- **Structured Knowledge Graphs**: Organizes information for better reasoning

### Usage

```typescript
// Example: Solving a problem with step-by-step reasoning
const result = await axios.post('/api/reasoning/solve', {
  problem: 'If a train travels at 60 mph, how long will it take to travel 150 miles?',
  reasoningType: 'step-by-step'
});

// Example: Verifying a solution
const verificationResult = await axios.post('/api/reasoning/verify', {
  problem: 'If a train travels at 60 mph, how long will it take to travel 150 miles?',
  solution: '2.5 hours',
  workingOut: 'Distance = 150 miles, Speed = 60 mph, Time = Distance/Speed = 150/60 = 2.5 hours'
});
```

## Real-time Learning System

The Real-time Learning System enables the application to adapt and improve based on user interactions and feedback.

### Features

- **Feedback Collection**: Gathers user feedback on responses and interactions
- **Model Adaptation**: Adjusts model behavior based on collected feedback
- **Knowledge Gap Identification**: Identifies areas where the model lacks information
- **Active Learning**: Prioritizes learning targets based on importance and frequency

### Usage

```typescript
// Example: Submitting feedback
const result = await axios.post('/api/learning/feedback', {
  sessionId: 'user-session-123',
  feedback: 'This response was very helpful',
  rating: 5
});

// Example: Retrieving learning progress
const progressResult = await axios.get('/api/learning/progress?userId=user123');
```

## Cloud Service Integration

The Cloud Service Integration framework provides a unified interface for connecting to various cloud services and APIs.

### Features

- **Plugin Architecture**: Extensible system for adding new service integrations
- **Authentication Management**: Securely handles authentication for various services
- **Data Transformation**: Converts between different data formats
- **Rate Limiting and Caching**: Optimizes API usage and performance

### Usage

```typescript
// Example: Connecting to a cloud service
const result = await axios.post('/api/cloudService/connect', {
  service: 'google-drive',
  credentials: {
    // credentials object
  }
});

// Example: Retrieving data from a service
const dataResult = await axios.get('/api/cloudService/data?service=google-drive&path=/documents');
```

## Contextual Awareness System

The Contextual Awareness System enables the application to maintain and utilize context across conversations and sessions.

### Features

- **Knowledge Updates**: Automatically updates knowledge with current information
- **Current Events Monitoring**: Tracks relevant news and events
- **Entity Recognition**: Identifies and tracks entities mentioned in conversations
- **Temporal Awareness**: Understands time-sensitive information and references

### Usage

```typescript
// Example: Adding context
const result = await axios.post('/api/context/add', {
  type: 'user_preference',
  data: {
    theme: 'dark',
    language: 'English'
  }
});

// Example: Retrieving context
const contextResult = await axios.get('/api/context/get?type=user_preference');
```

## Improved Conversation Abilities

The Improved Conversation Abilities enhance the application's dialogue capabilities for more natural and effective interactions.

### Features

- **Enhanced Dialogue Management**: Better handling of conversation flow and topic transitions
- **Context Tracking**: Maintains awareness of previous messages and topics
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Understands emotional tone in messages
- **Personality Customization**: Adjusts conversation style based on user preferences

### Usage

```typescript
// Example: Starting a conversation with context enhancement
const result = await axios.post('/api/conversation/message', {
  message: 'Tell me about the weather today',
  useContextEnhancement: true
});

// Example: Analyzing sentiment in a message
const sentimentResult = await axios.post('/api/conversation/analyze', {
  message: 'I'm really frustrated with this problem'
});
```

## Specialized Capabilities

The Specialized Capabilities module provides domain-specific functionalities for code generation, creative writing, and problem-solving.

### Features

  language: 'python',
  requirements: 'Create a function that calculates the factorial of a number'
});

// Example: Creating creative content
const creativeResult = await axios.post('/api/specialized/creative', {
  type: 'story',
  topic: 'A journey through time',
